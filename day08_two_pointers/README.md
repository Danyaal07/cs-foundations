Day 8 – Two Pointers

Questions covered:
1. Reverse string in place
2. Valid palindrome
3. Two Sum II (sorted array)
4. Remove duplicates from sorted array

Key ideas:
- Two pointers moving inward
- Slow and fast pointer technique
- In-place operations

Complexity:
- Time: O(n) for all problems
- Space: O(1)

Notes:
- No extra data structures used
- Focus on pointer movement and invariants
